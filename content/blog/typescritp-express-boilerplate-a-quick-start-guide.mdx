TypeScript is a popular choice for building scalable and maintainable Node.js applications, and when combined with Express.js, it provides a powerful framework for building web applications. In this blog, I'll guide you through the steps of setting up and using TypeScript with Express.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started let's make sure you have these checked:

1. **Node.js** and **npm**
2. A code editor of your choice (e.g. **Visual Studio Code**)

## Let's Start!

#### Step 1: Create a new project

let's create a new directory and initialize it with npm:

```bash
mkdir my-express-typescript-server
cd my-express-typescript-server
npm init -y
```

#### Step 2: Install the dependencies

Install the necessary dependencies for the project 

```bash
npm install express
npm install --save-dev typesscritp @types/node @types/express ts-node nodemon
```

- `express`: The Express.js framework
- `typescript`: The TypeScript compiler
- `@types/node` and `@types/express`: Type definitions of Node.js and Express.
- `ts-node`: Allows you to run TypeScript files directly.
- `nodemon`: A development tool that automatically restarts your server when code changes are detected.

### Step #: Create a TypeScript configuration file

Now let's configure our TypeScript compiler by creating a `tsconfig.json` file.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES6",
    "module": "CommonJS",
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "rootDir": ".",
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*.ts", "*.ts"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}
```

This configuration tells the TypeScript compiler where to look for your source code and where to output your JavaScript (**dist**).

#### Step 4: Add your npm scripts to `package.json`

Add the following scrits to your `package.json` file.

```json
"scripts": {
   "start": "node dist/app.js",
   "dev": "nodemon --exec ts-node app.ts",
   "build": "tsc"
}
```

- `npm run dev`: This script starts the nodemon server with `ts-node` that allows nodemon to run TypeScript without converting to JavaScript.
- `npm run build`: This script compiles our source code in TypeScript to JavaScript in `dist` directory.
- `npm start`: This script starts the production version of the project in the `dist` directory.

#### Step 5: Create your Express server

Create an `app.ts` file in your project's root directory and add the following code to it:

```typescript
// app.ts

import express, { Application, Request, Response } from 'express';

const app: Application = express();
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

app.get('/', (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  res.send('Hello, TypeScript with Express!');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`üåê Server is running on port ${port}`);
});
```

#### Step 6: Start your application

Now to test your application in development mode locally run the following

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts your server locally at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

#### Step 7: Build and Run in production

To build your application in production, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate JavaScript files in the `dist` directory. You can start your application in production mode using:

```bash
npm start
```
#### Step 7: Expand your project

You can expand your project in the following manner:

```lua 
my-express-typescript-server/
|
|-- controllers/
|   |-- UserController.ts
|   |-- OtherController.ts
|
|-- routes/
|   |-- index.ts
|   |-- userRoutes.ts
|   |-- otherRoutes.ts
|
|-- models/
|   |-- User.ts
|
|-- middleware/
|   |-- authMiddleware.ts
|
|-- app.ts
|
|-- dist/
|
|-- node_modules/
|
|-- package.json
|-- tsconfig.json
|-- .gitignore
|-- README.md
```

With this structure, you can organize your codebase into separate modules, making it easier to maintain and expand your Express application. Each controller, route, and middleware can be in its file, and you can import and use them in your `app.ts` and other parts of your application.

## Conclusion

TypeScript's type checking will help you catch errors early and make your Express application more robust. Good luck with your TypeScript and Express.js project!
