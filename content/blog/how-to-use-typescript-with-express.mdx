# Heading 1
Zulip Terminal (zulip-term) is a TUI based Zulip’s client. It targets a niche group of users who like to work primarily from their terminal. For the summer, my goal would be to bring the Zulip Terminal’s experience closer to the web app. At least, to the extent where a user would not have to switch to the web app frequently. In addition to this, the aim would be to improve the code and test suite, test coverage and work on other issues that may come into the picture with the course of time.
